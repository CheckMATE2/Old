Congratulations! If you are able to read this file, you apparently managed to download and extract the CheckMATE tarball! Now there is only a couple of steps which need to be done in order to install CheckMATE.

CheckMATE uses the standard ./configure + make + make install chain. For the configuration step, you must not provide --prefix (it will screw up the installation) but you have to provide the following parameters:
--with-rootsys=(ROOTDIR)
--with-delphes=(DELPHESDIR)

If desired, event generation can be enabled by furthermore providing the following optional parameters
--with-madgraph=(MG5MCNLODIR)
--with-pythia=(PYTHIADIR)

If you are not an expert on this subject, we highly recommend to go to the 'Installation Tutorial' on our website, http://checkmate.hepforge.org . There we will go through the above configuration step in all detail and most importantly explain to you how to find and install missing libraries.
